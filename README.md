# Levith's Personal Website

**Contributors:** `Levith Andrade Cuellar`

## Description
This repository contains the codebase for my personal website. This is a personal project I created to establish a professional online presence and to start a digital portfolio of my work and experiences. To develop this project I self-taught myself HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### Sections
Currently under construction! 
- **`"home"`** — The website's landing page featuring a split-flap board inspired display.
- **`"about"`** — A page containing a small bio and a carousel of personal photos.
- **`"experience"`** — A page containing some of my professional and academic experiences.
- **`"projects"`** — A catalogue of personal, academic and professional projects.

### Skills I've Learned Along The Way
- How to connect HTML elements with CSS.
- How to arrange HTML elements using CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid.
- How to dynamically scale text and other elements using CSS.
- How to "translate" Figma designs into HTML and CSS.
- How to make functioning carousels, dropdowns and dynamic tables using JavaScript.

*and many more!*
